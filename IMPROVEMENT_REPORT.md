## Changes Made

### 1. Bug Fixes ✅

| Issue | Fix | Files Changed |

| Product Hunt banner display bug | Fixed IIFE pattern → computed variable | `app/page.tsx` |

### 2. Security Improvements ✅

| Feature | Implementation |
|---------|----------------|
| Rate limiting | Added 10 requests/minute per IP on signup endpoint |
| New utility | Created `lib/rate-limit.ts` |
| Headers | Returns `Retry-After`, `X-RateLimit-Remaining`, `X-RateLimit-Reset` |

### 3. UX Improvements ✅

| Feature | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Social proof | "1 signup collected" (embarrassing) | "Join founders building viral waitlists" (when < 50) |
| Product Hunt banner | Always visible | Auto-hides 7 days after launch |
| Code example | Shows wrong domain | Shows correct `waitlistkit.ca` |

### 4. Documentation ✅

| `AUDIT.md` | New comprehensive audit with competitor analysis |

## Competitor Analysis Summary

**GetWaitlist (main competitor):**
- 44,650 users, 59M+ signups processed
- Pricing: $15/mo (Basic), $50/mo (Advanced), $250/mo (Pro)
- Features we're missing: Zapier, UTM tracking, public leaderboards, email verification

**WaitlistKit Advantages:**
- Lifetime pricing ($149 one-time)
- Open-source (MIT license, self-hostable)
- Modern stack (Next.js 16, React 19)
- Simpler pricing (4 tiers vs complex matrices)

## Known Issues / Future Work

### Not Addressed (Out of Scope)
1. ❌ No test coverage (needs 2-3 days)
2. ❌ Session-based admin auth (needs 1 day)
3. ❌ TypeScript strict mode (needs 4 hours)

### Feature Gaps vs Competitors
1. ❌ Webhook support
2. ❌ UTM parameter tracking  
3. ❌ Public leaderboards
4. ❌ Zapier integration
5. ❌ Email verification

### Recommendations for Next Sprint
1. Add webhook support (high impact, 1 day)
2. Implement UTM tracking (medium impact, 4 hours)
3. Add public leaderboard widget (medium impact, 1 day)
4. Write comparison blog post (WaitlistKit vs GetWaitlist)

## Deployment

| Environment | URL | Status |
|-------------|-----|--------|
| Production | https://waitlistkit.ca | ✅ Live |
| GitHub | https://github.com/tahseen137/waitlistkit | ✅ Updated |

---

## Validation Summary

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| Build passes | ✅ | Zero errors |
| Live site loads | ✅ | All pages working |
| Rate limiting works | ✅ | Returns 429 on abuse |
| Domain references correct | ✅ | All updated to waitlistkit.ca |
| Social proof smart | ✅ | Hides low numbers |
| README improved | ✅ | Badges, structure, docs |

**Overall Confidence: 85%**

The 15% gap is due to:
- No automated tests to verify changes don't break
- Manual testing only (no CI/CD test suite)
- Some edge cases not tested (webhook, payment flows)
