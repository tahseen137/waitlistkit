# Anticipated Questions & Answers

## 1. How is this different from Mailchimp/ConvertKit/etc?

**Answer:** Those are email marketing platforms—full-featured, complex, designed for newsletters and automation. WaitlistKit does one thing: waitlists with viral referrals. No email sending, no sequences, no bloat. Just a beautiful signup form that creates urgency and virality. Most people use us *before* they switch to an email platform.

## 2. What happens to my data? Can I export it?

**Answer:** Your data is yours. One-click CSV export with all emails, signup dates, referral counts, and positions. Export anytime, no lock-in. When you're ready to launch, download everything and import into whatever email tool you use.

## 3. Does it work with [my website platform]?

**Answer:** Yes! It's just a script tag—works anywhere you can add HTML. We've tested on:
- Static HTML sites
- React / Next.js / Vue
- Webflow, Squarespace, Carrd
- WordPress, Ghost
- Framer, Notion (with Super)

If it runs JavaScript, WaitlistKit works.

## 4. How does the referral system work exactly?

**Answer:** When someone signs up, they get a unique referral link (like `yoursite.com?ref=abc123`). When a friend clicks that link and signs up, two things happen:
1. The original user moves up in line
2. Their referral count increases (visible to them)

This creates social proof and urgency—people share because they want a better spot.

## 5. Is there a free tier? What are the limits?

**Answer:** Yes! Free includes:
- 1 waitlist
- 100 signups
- Full referral tracking
- Admin dashboard
- No credit card required

Pro ($19/mo) gets you 5 waitlists, 5K signups, and custom branding. Business ($49/mo) is unlimited everything.

## 6. Can I customize the look and feel?

**Answer:** Absolutely. You can customize:
- Primary color (matches your brand)
- Headline and subheadline
- Button text
- Logo

On Pro/Business, you get white-labeling and CSS overrides for pixel-perfect control.

## 7. Do you send emails or is it just the signup form?

**Answer:** WaitlistKit handles the signup form and referral tracking. We don't send emails (yet)—most founders have strong opinions about their email platform. Export your list to Mailchimp, ConvertKit, Loops, Resend, or whatever you use. We may add simple email notifications on Pro, but the focus is staying lightweight.

---

## 8. Is there an API?

**Answer:** Yes, on Business tier. You can:
- Fetch signups programmatically
- Add custom integrations
- Build your own admin dashboard
- Trigger webhooks on new signups

API docs coming soon.

## 9. How secure is it? Where is data stored?

**Answer:** Data is stored in a PostgreSQL database on secure infrastructure. All connections are encrypted (HTTPS). We don't sell or share your data—it's yours. Passwords are hashed, admin access uses secret tokens, and we follow security best practices.

---

## 10. What if I need help or have feature requests?

**Answer:** I'm super responsive! You can:
- Email me directly (on the site)
- DM on Twitter/X
- Open a GitHub issue

Pro and Business get priority support. I genuinely want to hear what would make this more useful for you.
