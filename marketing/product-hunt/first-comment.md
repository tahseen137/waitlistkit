Hey Product Hunt! 👋

I've launched a lot of side projects. And every single time, the same thing happens:

I need a waitlist. So I either:
- Waste an afternoon building one (database, forms, admin panel, referral logic...)
- Throw money at an enterprise tool that does way more than I need
- Just... skip it and collect emails in a Google Sheet like a caveman

None of these felt right.

**So I built WaitlistKit.**

The whole idea: copy one script tag, paste it on your landing page, and you're done. 60 seconds, not 6 hours.

The magic is the referral system. Each person who signs up gets a unique link. When their friends join, they move up the list. It's the same viral loop that Robinhood, Dropbox, and Morning Brew used—except you don't need to build it.

**The stack:**
- Next.js 14
- Prisma + Postgres
- Stripe for billing
- Deployed on Vercel

**What's next:**
- Webhooks for real-time integrations
- Slack/Discord notifications
- Email sequences (maybe?)
- Whatever you ask for 👇

I'm super curious what you think. Is this useful? What features would make you actually use it?

Would love your feedback. And if you launch something and use WaitlistKit, let me know—I'd love to see what you're building!

Thanks for checking it out 🙏
