# WaitlistKit — Full Description

## The Problem

You're about to launch something. You need a waitlist. Your options?

1. **Build it yourself** — waste days on auth, database, emails, admin UI
2. **Use a heavyweight tool** — pay $50+/mo, deal with complex setup, features you don't need
3. **Collect emails in a spreadsheet** — no referrals, no virality, looks amateur

None of these feel right for a fast-moving founder.

## The Solution

**WaitlistKit: One script tag. Done in 60 seconds.**

```html
<script src="https://waitlistkit.vercel.app/widget.js" 
        data-project="your-slug"></script>
```

That's it. Beautiful waitlist. On your site. Right now.

## How It Works

1. **Create your waitlist** — 30 seconds, no credit card
2. **Copy the script tag** — paste it anywhere on your site
3. **Visitors sign up** — they get a position and referral link
4. **They share** — friends who join move them up the list
5. **You track everything** — positions, referrals, exports

## Key Features

### ⚡ 60-Second Setup
No backend. No database. No auth system to build. Just one script tag.

### 🔗 Built-in Viral Referrals
Every signup gets a unique referral link. When friends join through that link, the original user moves up. This is the exact mechanic that made Dropbox, Robinhood, and Morning Brew explode.

### 🎨 Beautiful, Customizable Widget
Matches your brand automatically. Custom colors, copy, and styling. Looks native on any site.

### 📊 Admin Dashboard
See all signups, track referral chains, watch your waitlist grow in real-time.

### 🌐 Embeddable Anywhere
Works on any site: HTML, React, Next.js, Webflow, Squarespace, WordPress, Carrd—you name it.
